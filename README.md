# Kumpel

An LLM-assisted flashcard-based German language learning utility.

This project utilizes the Google Generative Language API (Gemini API). You need your own API key and running the program may incur costs. (See *LLM Usage Costs* below.)

## What is Kumpel?

Kumpel is a terminal-based program which helps you to understand written German texts. It's a guided learning experience consisting of back-and-forth conversational style content.

It's not intended to be a complete solution to learning German as it focuses on one aspect of language learning - reading. The aim is to improve the user's ability to understand German texts in written form i.e. there is no speaking, listening or writing of German - only reading.

## Why use Kumpel?

Use Kumpel if you want to learn German for the purpose of reading German texts. For example, if you don't live in Germany (or any other German-speaking country) and you want to enjoy reading German texts, you don't need to learn how to write, speak or listen to German - only how to read it. So use Kumpel to focus solely on the reading aspect of German learning.
